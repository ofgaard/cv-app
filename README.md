# CV Builder

Live Preview: https://cv-app-pi-one.vercel.app/

A simple React app that lets users build and print their resume. Works by letting user add/edit work and educational experience as well as their contact info.

The project is built with React and Tailwind.

This is my first ever React app built shortly after switching from vanilla JS and learning the basics of state and the passing of props between components. It's also my first project built Tailwind.
